This repository holds several modules, one per directory, for simulation withing
[[https://nemo.lpc-caen.in2p3.fr/wiki/Software/Bayeux][Bayeux]] framework :

- [[./geant4_validation/README.org][geant4_validation]] :: This directory sets up a minimal and simple geometry
     layout to test Geant4 simulation and to validate Geant4 Physics list. It
     generates plots of relevant physical "quantities" such as energy loss in
     materials, scattering angle distribution.
- [[./hpge_simulation/README.org][hpge_simulation]] :: This directory holds a full setup from geometry declaration
     to analysis modules to perform High Purity Germanium simulations.
